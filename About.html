        <br /> <br />I love doing work I feel good about. It doesn't have to change the world, but it has to have meaning. That's the core of what I do.
        <br /> <br />I've always been fascinated by the balance of opposites. Art and science, surfing and fighting, rock & roll and reggae, the yin needs the yang, man.
