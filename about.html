        <br /> <br />I am a passionate web designer & developer with 5 years of experience across multiple platforms, technologies, and industries. 
        <br /> <br />I currently manage the website and app for a major sports league and bring my experience from small and large organizations to create a refreshing and unique digital experience.
        <br /> <br />I like keeping things simple, strategic, and efficient so we can complete your project ahead of schedule and under budget.
        <br /> <br />A good website is an investment that will pay itself off in audience growth, ad revenue, and sales. And my goal is to build you quality product that will last. 
        <br /> <br />I take a lot of pride in my craft, as proven by my <a href="portfolio.html" class="link">portfolio</a> and <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ed7df3bc0ea9c9c4" class="link">Upwork</a> reviews.
